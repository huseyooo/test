            <p style="padding-left: 20px;"> 	I am good with being social with people, even when I can physically see and mentally feel that we are very different people I still find a way to make things work<sup>1</sup>. And in terms of learning new skills I am very careful with every step and I usually research about it before obtaining new skills like shuffle, mouth whistle etc<sup>2</sup>. I consider myself to be mentally strong by keeping myself intact while being under a lot of stress<sup>3</sup>. I am also good with video editing with the use of premiere pro<sup>4</sup>. I was able to become a freelance video editor during the pandemic being able to earn a small amount of funds<sup>5</sup>. Honestly one of my best times because I was able to connect to a foreign client and handled it professionally<sup>6</sup>. Also, learned a lot of cooking during the pandemic basing off a lot from online recipes<sup>7</sup>. Even though it must be common knowledge to know how to cook food, I liked to branch out when it comes to Filipino cuisine and put a twist on my own<sup>8</sup>. Much making adobo fried chicken, crispy pork chop kare kare and many more<sup>9</sup>. I have learned a lot throughout my life but I don't have that much to be specifically proud of or be boastful about but I'm happy with all the heightened common skills I have<sup>10</sup>.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">	I have played a lot of sports and other games throughout my life because I am a very open minded person<sup>1</sup>. At start my first sport was playing basketball<sup>2</sup>. Whenever me and my friends were free we usually played basketball and were surprised at how fast I could run with a ball considering I was a big boy that time<sup>3</sup>. And in the heat of summer I enrolled in swimming classes with the milo nestle program<sup>4</sup>. This led to me being able to challenge the waves whenever we were near beaches and it became my hobby to swim to the deepest depths of the shore<sup>5</sup>. I also loved badminton since my grandmother from my mother's side taught me how to play<sup>6</sup>. Also fell in love with the feeling of hitting the shuttlecock with my racket<sup>7</sup>. And during my childhood I would join my parents when they went to the office which was near a bunch of people playing billiards<sup>8</sup>. I’ve been wanting to play billiards because it looked fun at that time but I was too small so once I was tall enough I dedicated myself<sup>9</sup>. Much like badminton i fell in love with the feeling of the ball going in the hole<sup>10</sup>.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">	I always envy my childhood routine whenever I go through a rough day in the present. Thinking of nothing whenever I'm done with a class and just tune in and watch the new cartoon on the TV<sup>1</sup>. And laugh away all the weird stuff I used to do as a kid whenever I'm alone. I really love watchings shows, especially after watching them<sup>2</sup>. I love to analyse it in my free time<sup>3</sup>. Most especially today’s movie genre having a deeper story than the surface<sup>4</sup>. I loved also going into road trips<sup>5</sup>. Like whenever it was morning i loved going outside metro manila and when it was night i wanted to go in the central areas in metro manila<sup>6</sup>. I always fall in love with the environment and feeling after hours in Manila and the natural environment outside of Manila<sup>7</sup>. And whenever I get free time in the afternoon I love reading books<sup>8</sup>. Most especially when it's focused on improving your mindset<sup>9</sup>. I also love playing video games with my friends since one of our friends in the group is in Japan and it is the only way to connect with him<sup>10</sup>.
